# Cryptography: Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't confuse these!** Encoding ≠ Encryption ≠ Hashing. Each serves different security purposes.

Understanding the differences between encoding, encryption, and hashing is fundamental to application security. These concepts are often confused, but each serves different purposes and provides different security guarantees. This chapter clarifies these concepts and provides practical guidance for developers.

## The Fundamental Differences

> [!NOTE]
> Think of it this way: Encoding is like translating languages, Encryption is like using a secret code, Hashing is like creating a fingerprint.

| Purpose | Encoding | Encryption | Hashing |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Goal** | Data representation | Data protection | Data integrity |
| **Reversible** | Yes (trivial) | Yes (with key) | No |
| **Key Required** | No | Yes | No |
| **Security** | None | High | Medium-High |
| **Use Cases** | Data transmission | Confidentiality | Passwords, integrity |

### Quick Example

**Encoding** (Base64):
- Input: "Hello World"
- Output: "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
- Anyone can decode this easily

**Encryption** (AES):
- Input: "Hello World" + secret key
- Output: Random-looking encrypted bytes
- Only someone with the key can decrypt

**Hashing** (SHA-256):
- Input: "Hello World"
- Output: "a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b57b277d9ad9f146e"
- Cannot be reversed to get original input

## Encoding

Encoding transforms data from one format to another for compatibility, transmission, or storage purposes. **It provides no security.**

### What Encoding Is and Isn't

**Encoding IS:**
- A way to represent data in different formats
- Reversible without any secret information
- Useful for data compatibility and transmission
- Publicly documented standards

**Encoding is NOT:**
- A security measure
- A way to hide sensitive information
- Encryption (despite what some people think)

### Common Encoding Methods

**Base64 Encoding:**
Used to encode binary data into ASCII text format. Common in:
- Email attachments (MIME)
- Data URLs in web pages
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- API responses containing binary data

**Hexadecimal Encoding:**
Represents binary data using hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F). Each byte becomes two hex characters. Used in:
- Cryptographic key representation
- Hash function outputs
- Color codes in CSS (#FF0000 for red)
- Memory addresses and debugging

**URL Encoding:**
Converts special characters into a format safe for URLs. For example:
- Space becomes %20
- & becomes %26
- # becomes %23

### Security Implications

**Why Encoding ≠ Security:**
- Anyone can decode encoded data
- Encoding algorithms are public and standardized
- No secret key or password required
- Tools for decoding are freely available

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using Base64 encoding to "hide" passwords in configuration files
- Thinking URL encoding protects sensitive data in URLs
- Storing API keys in encoded (but not encrypted) format

## Encryption

Encryption transforms data into an unreadable format using a secret key. Only those with the correct key can decrypt and read the original data.

### Types of Encryption

**Symmetric Encryption:**
- Uses the same key for encryption and decryption
- Faster than asymmetric encryption
- Key distribution challenge: how do you securely share the key?
- Examples: AES, ChaCha20, DES (deprecated)

**Asymmetric Encryption:**
- Uses a pair of keys: public key for encryption, private key for decryption
- Solves the key distribution problem
- Slower than symmetric encryption
- Examples: RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

### Modern Encryption Standards

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**
- Symmetric encryption algorithm
- Key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- Industry standard for symmetric encryption
- Used in: HTTPS, VPNs, file encryption, database encryption

**ChaCha20:**
- Modern symmetric encryption algorithm
- Good performance on mobile devices
- Used in: TLS, VPNs, messaging apps
- Alternative to AES, especially where AES hardware acceleration isn't available

**RSA:**
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm
- Key sizes: 2048, 3072, or 4096 bits (1024-bit deprecated)
- Widely supported but slower than ECC
- Used in: TLS handshakes, email encryption, code signing

### Encryption Modes and Security

**Block Cipher Modes:**
When encrypting data larger than the cipher's block size, you need a mode of operation:

- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**: Each block depends on the previous block
- **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)**: Provides both encryption and authentication
- **CTR (Counter Mode)**: Turns block cipher into stream cipher

**Authentication:**
Encryption alone doesn't prevent tampering. Use authenticated encryption modes like:
- AES-GCM: Provides encryption + authentication
- ChaCha20-Poly1305: Stream cipher + authentication
- Encrypt-then-MAC: Separate encryption and authentication steps

### When to Use Encryption

**Data at Rest:**
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- File system encryption for laptops and servers
- Backup encryption for data protection

**Data in Transit:**
- HTTPS for web traffic
- VPNs for network communication
- Email encryption for sensitive communications

**Data in Use:**
- Application-level encryption for sensitive processing
- Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving computation

## Hashing

Hashing creates a fixed-size "fingerprint" of data. The same input always produces the same hash, but it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process.

### Hash Function Properties

**Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same hash output.

**Fixed Output Size:** Regardless of input size, the hash is always the same length (e.g., SHA-256 always produces 256 bits).

**Avalanche Effect:** Small changes in input produce dramatically different outputs.

**One-Way Function:** Computing the hash from input is easy, but finding an input that produces a specific hash is extremely difficult.

**Collision Resistant:** It should be very hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.

### Common Hash Functions

**SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm):**
- Part of the SHA-2 family
- Produces 256-bit (32-byte) hashes
- Widely used and considered secure
- Used in: Bitcoin, TLS certificates, digital signatures

**SHA-3:**
- Latest SHA standard, different design from SHA-2
- Alternative to SHA-2, not a replacement
- Good for applications requiring different security properties

**Blake2:**
- Modern hash function, faster than SHA-2
- Good for applications requiring high performance
- Used in: cryptocurrencies, password hashing libraries

**Deprecated Hash Functions:**
- **MD5**: Broken, do not use for security
- **SHA-1**: Deprecated, avoid for new applications
- **CRC32**: Not cryptographically secure, use only for error detection

### Password Hashing

Regular hash functions are too fast for password storage. Use specialized password hashing functions:

**Argon2 (Recommended):**
- Winner of password hashing competition
- Resistant to both GPU and ASIC attacks
- Configurable memory, time, and parallelism parameters
- Use Argon2id variant for most applications

**scrypt:**
- Memory-hard hash function
- Good alternative to Argon2
- Used by some cryptocurrencies

**bcrypt:**
- Older but still acceptable
- Based on Blowfish cipher
- Adaptive cost parameter

**PBKDF2:**
- Simple key derivation function
- Acceptable but not preferred for new applications
- Widely supported in legacy systems

### Hash Function Use Cases

**Data Integrity:**
- Verify file downloads haven't been corrupted
- Detect unauthorized changes to data
- Database integrity checks

**Digital Signatures:**
- Hash the document, then sign the hash
- More efficient than signing large documents
- Provides authentication and non-repudiation

**Proof of Work:**
- Bitcoin mining finds hashes with specific properties
- Rate limiting and anti-spam mechanisms
- Computational puzzles

**Data Deduplication:**
- Identify duplicate files by comparing hashes
- Cloud storage optimization
- Backup systems

## Key Management

Proper key management is crucial for cryptographic security. Even the strongest encryption is useless if keys are compromised.

### Key Generation

**Entropy Sources:**
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Gather entropy from multiple sources (mouse movements, disk activity, etc.)
- Hardware security modules (HSMs) for high-security environments
- Avoid predictable or weak random number sources

**Key Size Guidelines:**
- **Symmetric keys**: 256 bits for AES
- **RSA keys**: 2048 bits minimum, 3072+ bits preferred
- **ECC keys**: 256 bits (equivalent to 3072-bit RSA)

### Key Storage

**Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**
- Dedicated hardware for key storage and cryptographic operations
- Tamper-resistant and tamper-evident
- High-security environments (banks, CAs, government)

**Software-Based Storage:**
- Encrypted key stores (PKCS#12, JKS)
- Operating system key stores (Windows CryptoAPI, macOS Keychain)
- Cloud key management services (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)

**Best Practices:**
- Never store keys in plaintext
- Use separate systems for key storage and application logic
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular key rotation and backup procedures

### Key Distribution

**Asymmetric Key Distribution:**
- Public keys can be freely distributed
- Private keys must remain secret
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate management

**Symmetric Key Distribution:**
- Key distribution is the main challenge
- Use secure channels for initial key exchange
- Key derivation functions for generating session keys

## Common Cryptographic Mistakes

### Implementation Mistakes

**Rolling Your Own Crypto:**
Never implement cryptographic algorithms yourself. Use well-tested, peer-reviewed libraries instead.

**Weak Random Number Generation:**
Using predictable random numbers for keys or initialization vectors compromises security.

- DES or 3DES for new applications
- 1024-bit RSA keys

### Design Mistakes

**Encryption Without Authentication:**
Encryption alone doesn't prevent tampering. Always use authenticated encryption or encrypt-then-MAC.

**Reusing Initialization Vectors (IVs):**
Many encryption modes require unique IVs for each encryption operation.

**Side-Channel Vulnerabilities:**
- Timing attacks on password comparison
- Power analysis on cryptographic operations
- Cache-based attacks

### Operational Mistakes

**Poor Key Management:**
- Not planning for key rotation
